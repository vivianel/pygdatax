class decorator(object):
    """
    When using a decorator, the function that is being decorated
    loses its __name__, docstring, and signature.
    For example, consider the generic decorator ``my_decorator``:
        def my_decorator(fn):
            def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
                print 'Calling', fn.__name__
                result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
                print 'Done with', fn__name__
                return result
            return wrapped
    and the decorated function ``my_function``:
        @my_decorator
        def my_function(a, b, c, d):
            pass
    Preserving the function's __name__ and docstring are simple enough
    either by outright copying or using the helper function ``functools.wraps``,
    however, ``my_function``'s signature will remain the same as ``wrapped``:
    ``*args, **kwargs``. This isn't a that big of a problem until introspection
    is needed.
    Python classes are capable of being used as decorators, however,
    whenever a class is used as a decorator, the function actually
    becomes an instance of that class. Again this is a problem
    for introspection.
    The "solution" is to make the class look completely like the function
    Using this class as a standalone decorator acts as an identity function.
    To get the most use, this should be subclassed. When calling the decorated
    function, several things occur:
    1. The ``__call__`` method is invoked.
    1. The ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` get set as attributes of the instance.
    1. The ``before_call`` method is invoked.
    1. ``self.function`` is called with ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` and
       the result is stored in ``self.result``.
    1. The ``after_call`` method is invoked.
    1. The result in ``self.result`` is returned.
    It is intended that only ``before_call`` and ``after_call`` are to be
    overridden in subclasses.
